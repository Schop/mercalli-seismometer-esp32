# ESP32 Mercalli Seismometer

A highly sensitive, WiFi and BLE-enabled seismometer based on the ESP32 microcontroller and an ADXL345 accelerometer. It measures vibrations, tracks peak values, calculates the Mercalli intensity scale, and provides real-time data via an OLED display, a web interface, and a BLE service. Features advanced event logging with NTP time synchronization and intelligent WiFi provisioning.

## Usage

### First Boot: WiFi Setup

On first boot, if no WiFi credentials are configured, the device will start in **Access Point mode**:
1. **Connect to the AP**: Look for a WiFi network named "Seismometer-XXXXXX" (where XXXXXX is part of the device's MAC address)
2. **Open Configuration Portal**: Navigate to `http://192.168.4.1` in your browser

4. **Enter Password**: Provide the WiFi password
5. **Save & Connect**: The device will restart and connect to your WiFi network

### Calibration

After WiFi setup, the device automatically starts calibration:
- **Keep the device perfectly still** on a level surface during calibration
- The OLED display and Serial Monitor show the progress
- This process measures the sensor's baseline and calculates ambient noise levels
- The IP address is displayed during calibration for immediate web access

## Configuration & Customization

### Mercalli Intensity Thresholds

The Mercalli scale thresholds can be adjusted in `main.cpp`:
```cpp
const float MERCALLI_3_THRESHOLD = 0.4;   // III - Weak
const float MERCALLI_4_THRESHOLD = 0.7;   // IV - Light
const float MERCALLI_5_THRESHOLD = 1.2;   // V - Moderate
// ... etc
```

### Event Logging Parameters

Event logging behavior can be customized:
```cpp
const unsigned long MIN_EVENT_INTERVAL = 10000;  // Minimum 10 seconds between events
#define MAX_EVENTS 50  // Maximum number of stored events
```

### Network Settings

NTP servers and timing can be configured:
```cpp
const char* ntpServer1 = "pool.ntp.org";
const char* ntpServer2 = "time.nist.gov";
const char* ntpServer3 = "time.google.com";

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi Connection Issues
- **Check Credentials**: Use `STATUS` command to verify stored SSID/password
- **Signal Strength**: Ensure ESP32 is within WiFi range
- **Fallback Mode**: Device automatically starts AP mode if WiFi fails
- **Manual Reset**: Use `SSID` and `PASS` commands to reconfigure

### Calibration Problems
- **Keep Still**: Ensure device is motionless during calibration
- **Level Surface**: Place on stable, level surface
- **Recalibrate**: Use `CALIBRATE` command to repeat process
- **Check Wiring**: Verify ADXL345 connections

### Event Logging Issues
- **Time Sync**: Requires internet connection for NTP synchronization
- **Check Status**: Use `STATUS` command to verify time sync status
- **Manual Clear**: Use `CLEAREVENTS` if log appears corrupted

### Performance Optimization
- **Upload Speed**: Configured for 921600 baud for faster uploads
